abstract="The variants of recurrent neural networks such as long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit are successful in sequence modelling such as automatic speech recognition. However, the decoded sequence is prune to have false substitutions, insertions and deletions. In our work, we investigate the outcome of the hidden layers in LSTM trained on TIMIT dataset. We found interestingly that the first hidden layer was capturing information related to some broad manners of articulation. The successive hidden layers try to cluster among the broad manners of articulation. We detected two broad manners of articulation, namely sonorants (vowels, semi-vowels, nasals) and obstruents (fricatives, stops, affricates) by exploiting the spectral flatness measure (SFM) on the linear prediction coefficients. We define a additional gate called manner of articulation gate that is high if the broad manners of articulation of tth frame are same as that of {\$}{\$}(t+1){\$}{\$}(t+1)th frame. The manner of articulation detection is embedded at the output of the activation gate of LSTM at the first hidden layer. By doing so, the sonorants being substituted as obstruents are minimized at the output layer. The proposed method decreased the phone error rates by 0.7{\%} when evaluated on the core test set of the TIMIT.",

abstract = "In this paper, a novel approach to unsupervised pattern discovery for speech signals is proposed. The proposed work deviates from the standard speech recognition task, and aims to cluster the speech utterances based on the vocabulary of a broad topic. It attempts to discover the matched sequence of phonetic units by making use of the repeated patterns between the speech signals. Identification of matched sequence of phonetic patterns helps in clustering the speech signals, automatically. The proposed approach uses the posterior features derived from Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to find the repeated structure between the speech signals. Image processing techniques are used to identify these matched acoustic patterns. An angle histogram-based method is used to extract the desired matched keyword/phrase patterns present in a pair of speech utterances. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on Hindi and Bengali news speech corpora using standard objective measures, and also compared with state-of-the-art techniques. The matched pairs of speech utterances obtained by the proposed method are grouped into broader classes using an appropriate clustering technique. The final clusters represent the broader classes of information such as politics, sports, and weather."

abstract="In this paper, a time-domain adaptive filtering-based melody extraction method is proposed. The proposed method works in multiple stages to extract the vocal melody (singer's fundamental frequency) from vocal polyphonic music signals. The vocal and non-vocal regions of the music signal are identified by the strength of excitation of the source signal. The vocal regions are further segmented into the sequence of notes by detecting their onsets in the frequency representation of the composite signal. The melody contour in each of the vocal note segment is obtained by adaptive zero-frequency filtering in the time domain. The performance of the proposed melody extraction method is compared with the current state-of-the-art melody extraction method in respect of voicing recall rate, voicing false alarm rate, raw pitch, and overall accuracy.",

    abstract="In this work, we propose a mapping function based feature transformation framework for developing consonant--vowel (CV) recognition system in the emotional environment. An effective way of conveying messages is by expressing emotions during human conversations. The characteristics of CV units differ from one emotion to other emotions. The performance of existing CV recognition systems is degraded in emotional environments. Therefore, we have proposed mapping functions based on artificial neural network and GMM models for increasing the accuracy of CV recognition in the emotional environment. The CV recognition system has been explored to transform emotional features to neutral features using proposed mapping functions at CV and phone levels to minimize mismatch between training and testing environments. Vowel onset and offset points have been used to identify vowel, consonant and transition segments. Transition segments are identified by considering initial 15{\%} speech samples between vowel onset and offset points. The average performance of CV recognition system is increased significantly using feature mapping technique at phone level in three emotional environments (anger, happiness, and sadness).",

    abstract="In this work, we have developed a speech mode classification model for improving the performance of phone recognition system (PRS). In this paper, we have explored vocal tract system, excitation source and prosodic features for development of speech mode classification (SMC) model. These features are extracted from voiced regions of a speech signal. In this study, conversation, extempore, and read speech are considered as three different modes of speech. The vocal tract component of speech is extracted using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). The excitation source features are captured through Mel power differences of spectrum in sub-bands (MPDSS) and residual Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (RMFCCs) of the speech signal. The prosody information is extracted from pitch and intensity. Speech mode classification models are developed using above described features independently, and in fusion. The experiments carried out on Bengali speech corpus to analyze the accuracy of the speech mode classification model using the artificial neural network (ANN), naive Bayes, support vector machines (SVMs) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). We proposed four classification models which are combined using maximum voting approach for optimal performance. From the results, it is observed that speech mode classification model developed using the fusion of vocal tract system, excitation source and prosodic features of speech, yields the best performance of 98{\%}. Finally, the proposed speech mode classifier is integrated to the PRS, and the accuracy of phone recognition system is observed to be improved by 11.08{\%}.",

As mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are extracted from the magnitude of the Fourier transform, we have combined this MFCC-based system with our phase-based systems to exploit the complete information contained in a speech signal. In this work, we have used IITKGP-MLILSC speech database and OGI Multi-language Telephone Speech (OGI-MLTS) corpus for our experiments. We have used Gaussian mixture models for building the language models. From the experimental results it is observed that the LID accuracy obtained from our proposed phase based features is comparable with MFCC features. We have also observed some performance improvement in the LID accuracy on combining the proposed phase-based systems with the state of the art MFCC-based system.",

    abstract="In this paper, a time-domain adaptive filtering-based melody extraction method is proposed. The proposed method works in multiple stages to extract the vocal melody (singer's fundamental frequency) from vocal polyphonic music signals. The vocal and non-vocal regions of the music signal are identified by the strength of excitation of the source signal. The vocal regions are further segmented into the sequence of notes by detecting their onsets in the frequency representation of the composite signal. The melody contour in each of the vocal note segment is obtained by adaptive zero-frequency filtering in the time domain. The performance of the proposed melody extraction method is compared with the current state-of-the-art melody extraction method in respect of voicing recall rate, voicing false alarm rate, raw pitch, and overall accuracy.",

	abstract = {SUMMARY In this paper, we are exploring features extracted from steady vowel segments for improving the performance of speaker identification system under background noise. Steady vowel regions are produced by periodic impulse‐like excitation and they contain relatively high signal energy. Hence, speaker specific information present in steady vowel regions may be less affected by the noise. In this work, steady vowel regions are determined by using the knowledge of accurate vowel onset points and epochs. Speaker identification studies are carried out using TIMIT database for white and vehicle noises. Universal background model–Gaussian mixture model‐based modeling is explored for developing speaker models. Significant improvement in the performance of speaker identification is observed by using features extracted from steady vowel region in presence of noisy environments.

	abstract = {SUMMARY In this paper, we proposed a method for improving the recognition performance of 145 prominent consonant–vowel (CV) units in Indian languages for low bit‐rate coded speech. Proposed CV recognition method is carried out in two levels to reduce the similarity among a large number of CV classes. In the first level, vowel category of CV unit will be recognized, and in the second level, consonant category will be recognized. At each level of the proposed method, complementary evidences from support vector machine and hidden Markov models are combined to enhance the recognition performance. Effectiveness of the proposed two‐level CV recognition method is demonstrated by performing the recognition of isolated CV units and CV units collected from the Telugu broadcast news database. In this work, vowel onset point (VOP) is used as an anchor point for extracting accurate features from the CV unit. Therefore, a method is proposed for accurate detection of VOP in clean and coded speech. The proposed VOP detection method is based on the spectral energy in 500–2500 Hz frequency band of the speech segments present in the glottal closure region. Speech coders considered in this work are GSM full rate (ETSI 06.10), CELP (FS‐1016), and MELP (TI 2.4 kbps). Significant improvement in CV recognition performance is achieved using the proposed two‐level method compared with the existing methods under both clean and coded conditions.

Prosodic parameters of speech at syllable level depend on positional, contextual and phonological features of the syllables. In this paper, neural networks are explored to model the prosodic parameters of the syllables from their positional, contextual and phonological features. The prosodic parameters considered in this work are duration and sequence of pitch (F                0) values of the syllables. These prosody models are further examined for applications such as text to speech synthesis, speech recognition, speaker recognition and language identification. Neural network models in voice conversion system are explored for capturing the mapping functions between source and target speakers at source, system and prosodic levels. We have also used neural network models for characterizing the emotions present in speech. For identification of dialects in Hindi, neural network models are used to capture the dialect specific information from spectral and prosodic features of speech.",

In this paper, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) have been used to represent the speaker specific information. A simulated speech corpus of Hindi language are used to check the performance of speaker recognition in emotional environment. The emotions included in this study are anger, neutral, sad, happy and surprise. Emotion recognition models are developed using Gaussian mixture models. Performance of speaker recognition is studied in emotional environment. The results show that emotions play vital role in speaker recognition.",

abstract="In this chapter, we propose speaker-specific prosodic features for improving the performance of speaker recognition in noisy environments. This approach can be especially useful in the forensic analysis of speech. Degradation in speaker recognition is a common phenomenon observed due to transmission and channel impairments, microphone variability and background noise. In this work spectral features are used to perform speaker recognition in the first stage and dynamic aspects of speaker-specific prosody are used to improve the performance in the second stage. For this task, speech corpus is collected at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, using 50 speakers recorded over the mobile phone. Background noise is simulated using additive white random noise from Noisex database. Speech enhancement techniques are used to improve the speaker recognition performance in the case of noisy speech. Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and support vector machines                 support vector machines               (SVMs                 SVMs              ) are used for developing speaker models. Performance of the speaker recognition system is observed to be 55 and 66{\%} using prosodic and spectral features respectively, for TIMIT speech at 15 dB SNR.                 TIMIT database              . The speaker recognition performance of around 73{\%} is achieved using the combination of spectral and prosodic features for noisy speech after speech enhancement.",

abstract="In this chapter we discuss modeling of supra-segmental features (intonation and duration) of syllables, and suggest some applications of these models. These supra-segmental features are also termed as prosodic features, and hence the corresponding models are known as prosody models. Neural networks are used to capture the implicit duration and intonation knowledge in the sequence of syllables of an utterance. A four layer feedforward neural network trained with backpropagation algorithm is used for modeling the duration and intonation knowledge of syllables separately. Labeled broadcast news data in the languages Hindi, Telugu and Tamil is used to develop neural network models in order to predict the duration and F0 of syllables in these languages. The input to the neural network consists of a feature vector representing the positional, contextual and phonological constraints. For improving the accuracy of prediction, further processing is done on the predicted values. We also propose a two-stage duration model for improving the accuracy of prediction. The performance of the prosody models is evaluated using objective measures such as average prediction error, standard deviation and correlation coefficient. The prosody models are examined for applications such as speaker recognition, language identification and text-to-speech synthesis.",

abstract="In this paper, a speech document indexing system and similarity-based document retrieval method has been proposed. K-d tree is used as the index structure and codebooks derived from speech documents present in the database, are used during retrieval of desired document. Each document is represented as a sequence of codebook indices. The longest common subsequence based approach is proposed for retrieving the documents. Proposed retrieval method is evaluated using a speech database of 3 hours recorded by a male speaker and speech queries from 5 male and 5 female speakers. The accuracy of retrieval is found to be about 88{\%} for the queries given by male speakers.",
